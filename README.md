Firstly, you can create next project:
New-Maven project - (choose "create a simple project") - Enter Group ID and Artifact Id (it's just like a folder name. It doesn't matter for us now) - press Finish.
In the end of the Project explorer you can find "pom file." Please, check my Pom file. Find  <dependencies> and put it in your project

Now you can use @Test annotations. Good luck.
